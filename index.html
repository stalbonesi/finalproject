		About the map
		</subheader>
		<p>U.S. cities have experienced a tremendous rebirth over the past decade, as young professionals and families increasingly choose to reside in urban environments over suburban communities. New York City is no exception to this trend; since 2000, the city has added nearly 400,000 residents, spread across all five boroughs.</p>

	<div class="eight columns">
		<p>This map provides a glimpse at where new residential construction is occurring across the city to accomade the surge of city dwellers. Specifically, it identifies which neighborhoods have constructed the most new residential units since 2000. It is important to keep in mind that the numbers do not represent net change; rather, they only represent the aggregate number of newly constructed residential units, regardless of whether new units simply replaced older ones. All residential data was obtained from the NYC Planning Department's MapPLUTO database.</p>

		Manhattan
		</subheader>
		<p>Manhattan has constructed the most residential units of any borough since 2000 (81,518). The west side neighborhoods of Hudson Yards-Chelsea-Flatiron-Union Square and Clinton constructed more residential units than any other neighborhood in the city (14,679 and 12,359 units, respectively). Much of this growth has been triggered by the completion of new open spaces such as the High Line and Hudson River Park. Rounding out the top five were Battery Park City-Lower Manhattan (5,933), Midtown-Midtown South (5,629), and Lincoln Square (4,981).</p>

		Brooklyn
		</subheader>
		<p>Brooklyn was a close second, having constructed 77,973 units since 2000. Leading the way was North Side-South Side (Wiiliamsburg) (9,115), followed by DUMBO-Vinegar Hill-Downtown Brooklyn-Boerum Hill (6,987). Williamsburg has become a preferred neighborhood choice among younger generations, and has seen the rapid replacement of its historical industrial fabric with new residential buildings. DUMBO meanwhile, has been transformed from a sleepy industrial area to an expensive mixed use neighborhood with desirable waterfront access, and Downtown Brooklyn has seen a residential high rise building boom that has further densified the area. Rounding out the top five were East New York (5,026), Bedford (4,551), and Bushwick South (4,523).</p>

		Queens
		</subheader>
		<p>Queens was a distant third, having constructed 55,643 units since 2000. Hunters Point-Sunnyside-West Maspeth constructed by far the most residential units of any neighborhood (8,434). Hunters Point accounted for the majority of the growth, having been a recent beneficiary of a city rezoning of much of the area from industrial to residential. The neighborhood was followed by Flushing, whose large Chinese population has been an active player in residential growth. Hammels-Arverne-Edgemere (3,150), Old Astoria (2,432), and North Corona (2,364) round out the top five.</p>

		Bronx
		</subheader>
		<p>The Bronx has constructed 37,479 residential units since 2000. The South Bronx neighborhoods of Morrisania-Melrose and Melrose South-Mott Haven North constructed the most units (3,991 and 3,209, respectively). City-owned properties that have been redeveloped under an area Urban Renewal Plan have accounted for a large amount of the growth in these neighborhoods. Rounding out the top five were Williamsbridge-Olinville (2,429), East Tremont (2,347), and Highbridge (2,307).</p>

		Staten Island
		</subheader>
		<p>Since 2000, 18,406 units have been constructed on Staten Island. Charleston-Richmond Valley-Tottenville - at the southernmost end of the island - led the way, with the construction of 2,236 units. While the area is relatively far from the rest of NYC, its accessibility to New Jersey and the Staten Island Railway led to the construction of several new large scale developments. The neighborhood was followed by neighboring Annadale-Huguenot-Prince's Bay-Eltingville, which constructed 1,621 units. Rounding out the top five were Rossville-Woodrow (1,470), Mariner's Harbor-Arlington-Port Ivory-Graniteville (1,335), and West New Brighton-New Brighton-St. George (1,324).</p>
